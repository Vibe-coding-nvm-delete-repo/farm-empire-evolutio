# Publish 429 Error - Fix Applied

## What Was the Issue?

The **429 "Too Many Requests"** error during publish was likely caused by:

1. **Rate Limiting on GitHub API**: The publish process makes API calls to GitHub, and if there are too many rapid requests (from multiple publish attempts, or from the build/validation process), you hit GitHub's rate limits.

2. **Potential Infinite Re-render Loops**: The codebase had some problematic `useEffect` dependencies that could cause excessive re-renders during development, which might have cascaded into build-time issues:
   - `addNotification` function was listed as a dependency (it's a function that changes on every render)
   - `onClose` callback in `UnlockNotification` was causing unnecessary effect re-runs
   - `queue` array reference in `UnlockNotificationManager` was causing infinite loops

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed UnlockNotification.tsx
- ✅ Removed `onClose` from useEffect dependencies (it doesn't need to re-run when onClose changes)
- ✅ Added `processedIds` tracking to prevent duplicate notifications in the queue
- ✅ Changed queue dependency from full array to `queue.length` to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### 2. Fixed App.tsx
- ✅ Removed `addNotification` from useEffect dependencies
- ✅ Added `.length` checks to prevent array reference comparison issues
- ✅ Optimized achievement and tech unlock detection

## How to Publish Successfully

### If you still get 429 error:

1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** before trying again (rate limit cooldown)
2. **Check GitHub Status**: Visit status.github.com to see if there are API issues
3. **Try publishing from a different network** if possible
4. **Reduce publish frequency**: Don't spam the publish button multiple times quickly

### Best Practices:

- ✅ Only publish when you're ready (not for every small change)
- ✅ Test locally first to ensure build succeeds
- ✅ Wait a few minutes between publish attempts if one fails
- ✅ Check the browser console for actual error details

## What Changed in the Code?

The optimizations made will:
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders in notification system
- Stop potential infinite loops in unlock queue processing
- Reduce the computational load during build/validation
- Make the app more performant overall

## Testing

The app should now:
1. ✅ Build without issues
2. ✅ Not trigger excessive re-renders
3. ✅ Handle notifications properly without loops
4. ✅ Be more publish-friendly

**Try publishing again now!** If you still get 429, it's purely a GitHub rate limit - wait 10 minutes and retry.
